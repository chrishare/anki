It is tempting to fill a day with busy work, but this leaves critical work undone, or makes it unavoidable later in the day when willpower has been expended. Plans can change meaning critical but deferred work might not get done at all.

## Question Yourself, and Reason from First Principles

Reasoning from first principles can mean escaping 'that's just how it is done' bias, possibly enabling better solutions. Think critically about long-help assumptions. Use feedback loops, where you think about your thoughts and plans, to improve them and identify when they are not working.

## Prefer Asynchronous Communication

Realtime communcations like meetings, Slack/Skype, and phone calls are best suited when you need other people's experience and feedback. However, meetings etc are often not really needed, and being available for others means being available for disruptions, which prevents deep work. Prefer asynchronous communication when possible. Don't feel bad for turning off notifications and so on.

## Focus on One Thing

Context switching, when dealing with multiple issues, does satisfy the urge to 'get to everything' but is false; focusing on one thing at a time means getting things done faster, and better. Each context switch adds a certain amount of time and thought overhead, to remember context and 'catch up'. Avoid that by focusing on one thing at once.

## Communicate the Big Picture

If people don't understand the big picture, the ideals and the goals we are working towards, they cannot help ensure that what they are doing is well-directed. While some people's task may not require the context of a bigger picture, that is rare, and sharing that bigger picture gives them a map that they can use to ensure their work and innovation will help getting to the destination.

## Batch Tasks and Multitask when Appropriate

If you have a kind of task that you perform multiple times a week, and you can perform it once a week, do so, especially when switching into that context is expensive - such as starting an app and so on. Really, each instance is just one big task - and we like to focus on one task at once.

When possible, multitask. If a meeting is necessary, and doesn't require your full attention, use some of that time to perform tasks that don't require full attention.

## Automate (Nearly) Everything

Anything that is repeated, or error prone, is prime for automation. When automating, it is crucial to do a cost-value estimate of the valoue it will provide.

Set Goals and Make Them Incremental, but Ambitious

Set clear, well defined goals that you can measure progress against. Make them incremental. Make them lead to ambitious goals. They need to be realistic. They need to be targeted on what one really wants. Too many goals reduces the likelihood of meeting any.
