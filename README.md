# anki

This repo contains my various spaced-repetition notes (Anki flashcards) in markdown and apkg format.

I use this tool to convert from markdown to apkg: https://github.com/ashlinchak/mdanki

Sample command:

```
mdanki simple.md simple.apkg
```

Note - I don't necessarily structure all of these cards in a cloze (missing word) or Q/A format for testing recall. Sometimes, I'll have something like a short sample program and expect myself to say 'passed' only if I understand what the code is doing. This is to reduce the number of cards and avoid so much effort producing cards.
